#In this SQL, I've queried a database to display statistics related to famous female actresses, singers, fictional characters, and authors.

#1. Name famous female actresses that also sing.
SELECT DISTINCT fa.a_id, fa.first_name, fa.last_name, fa.net_worth
FROM female_actresses AS fa
INNER JOIN female_singers AS fs
ON fa.a_id = fs.s_id;

#2. Female artists that can sing, act and have a net worth greater than 25000000 in alphabetical order.
SELECT DISTINCT fa.first_name, fa.last_name, fa.net_worth
FROM female_actresses AS fa
LEFT JOIN female_singers AS fs
ON fa.a_id = fs.s_id
WHERE fa.net_worth AND fs.net_worth > 25000000
ORDER BY fa.first_name ASC;

#3. Famous female actresses that have played fictional characters.
SELECT DISTINCT fa.first_name, fa.last_name, ffc.Fictional_Character, ffc.movie_or_tv_title AS Movie
FROM Female_Actresses AS fa
INNER JOIN female_fictional_character AS ffc
ON fa.a_id = ffc.fc_id

#4. Name the top 2 actresses that have also written a book.
SELECT fc.first_name, fc.last_name, fc.age, fc.from_state, fc.married
FROM female_authors AS s
INNER JOIN female_actresses AS fc
ON s.w_id = fc.a_id
LIMIT 2;

#5. Which famous female actresses have yet to play a fictional character?
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, s.age, s.from_state
FROM female_authors AS s
LEFT JOIN female_fictional_character AS fc
ON fc.fc_id = s.w_id
GROUP BY s.first_name
